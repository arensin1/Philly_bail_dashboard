# Philly_bail_dashboard
<p>Creates a dashboard with data visuals for one to explore. I used pyplot and dash /br> to create data visuals and graphs with the data provided by Philly Bail Fund. I would test my graphs on jupyter notebook so that I could tweak them as needed. Then I created an application using dash in python to create the dashboard for the data visuals. </p>
