# Philly_bail_dashboard

# Background
<p>Creates a dashboard with data visuals for one to explore. I used pyplot and dash to create data visuals and graphs with the data provided by Philly Bail Fund. I would test my graphs on jupyter notebook so that I could tweak them as needed. Then I created an application using dash in python to create the dashboard for the data visuals.  </p>

# How To Use
<p>One should be able to clone repo. After that, you would just have to run Data.dashboard.py and a server should appear giving the user access to the dashboard. </p>
